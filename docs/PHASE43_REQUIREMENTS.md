# ReqBot Phase 43 — Reranker Spike

**Status:** Complete — measured, **No-Go** on shipping FlashRank as configured. Tested both the
default `ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2-v2` and the larger `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`; neither clears the
gate. No default changed; see §11 Findings.
**Date:** 2026-08-02
**Preceded by:** Phase 42 (Table-Structure-Aware Serialization) — `docs/PHASE42_REQUIREMENTS.md`,
complete. This phase picks up the reranker recommendation carried forward from Phase 40's §8
Backlog and reaffirmed in Phase 41 and Phase 42's own backlog notes — see §1 below.
**Followed by:** Not decided. §11's Backlog names one bounded follow-up experiment (§11.5: capture
the actual pre-rerank candidate pools and test the reranker's input text on identical pools — no
new dependency; note both models tested here are already cross-encoders) plus the pre-existing
Evidence/Compare and WP-15.9 items from §3/§7 — none started, no decision made on which (if any)
to pick up next.

## 1. Phase Framing

Phase 40's failure-mode audit of the 45-query gold set found `over_grab` (42 occurrences — the
single largest finding of any kind, spread across 19 queries) and `ranking_miss` (17, or 8
excluding one heavy query, `Q-B05`) as the two largest categories: cases where the correct
requirement is retrievable but not well-ranked, or a wrong one displaces it in the final top-k.
WP-40's own conclusion: "a reranker is the best-evidenced single lever" — deferred to backlog
rather than built, pending its own scoping conversation.

Phase 41 swept 11 `min_score` thresholds (0.02–0.5) against the same gold set specifically to see
whether a threshold could fix zero-truth (deliberately off-topic) queries confidently returning
irrelevant results. Finding: **0 of 8 zero-truth queries correctly returned empty at any threshold
tested, including 0.5.** Off-topic queries' top scores ranged 0.5–1.07 (e.g. `Q-Z03`, "federal tax
withholding") — routinely *higher* than genuine weak matches (`Q-B05`'s relevant results scored
0.033–0.09). The score distributions are inverted, not merely overlapping, so no threshold on the
RRF-fused score can separate them. Phase 41's conclusion: "the real fix needs a calibrated
absolute-relevance signal (e.g. a cross-encoder reranker's own confidence score), not a threshold
on an already-fused ranking score" — strengthening rather than replacing WP-40's recommendation.

Phase 42 then produced a concrete, current example of `ranking_miss` in the live corpus: after
WP-42's table-serialization fix made `Q-T02`'s correct records extractable for the first time, the
query still scores 0 recall@20 in production. Checked directly with `core.ask.retrieve(top_k=100,
min_score=0)`, the correct records are present, correctly grounded, and verbatim — ranked
33rd/51st/69th/87th of 100, entirely outside production's `top_k=20`. Phase 42 explicitly flagged
this as "WP-40's own dominant, already-deferred-to-the-reranker finding," out of scope for that WP.

This is the third phase in a row to surface or reaffirm the same recommendation without acting on
it. This phase is that scoping conversation, turned into an implementation plan.

Prior planning already exists and this phase follows it rather than redesigning from scratch:
`docs/TODO_future_improvements.txt`'s "Retrieval Experiments" §1, and the fuller architecture
writeup in `archive/PHASE15_EXTENSION_RETRIEVAL_HARDENING.md` (WP-15.5), which specified the
candidate-pool-then-rerank architecture, the FlashRank-first library choice, and explicit
reject-if criteria.

**Scope discipline:** this is a measurement-gated spike, not a change that ships default-on.
`rerank` defaults to `False` everywhere it's added in this phase; production retrieval behavior is
unchanged unless and until a future decision, informed by this phase's measured results, turns it
on.

## 2. Goals

1. Resolve, explicitly and up front, whether this phase touches only the Ask/Search retrieval path
   (`core.ask.retrieve()`) or first centralizes the duplicated retrieval logic in Evidence/Compare —
   see §4.
2. Build a local reranker as a reusable, retrieval-agnostic component and wire it into
   `core.ask.retrieve()` behind an opt-in flag.
3. Measure it against the 45-query gold set (`eval/gold_retrieval_queries.jsonl`): Precision@5,
   Recall@5/10/20, MRR, zero-truth score behavior, and latency — baseline vs. reranked.
4. Produce a go/no-go recommendation from that data. Do not flip any default in this phase
   regardless of outcome.

## 3. Non-Goals

- **Evidence/Compare reranking.** Both `services/evidence_service.py:build()` and
  `services/compare_service.py:compare()`'s semantic path independently reimplement dense+sparse
  embed and RRF `query_points()` rather than calling `core.ask.retrieve()` — confirmed by direct
  code inspection (see §4). Neither currently has fusion headroom past `top_k` for a reranker to
  reorder within (`query_points(..., limit=top_k)` directly, no separate pool size). Extending
  reranking to them is a named follow-up WP, not silently assumed here — see §7.
- **WP-15.9's corrective retrieval gate** (replacing `min_score` with the reranker's own score as
  the zero-truth confidence signal). Explicitly depends on this phase's output; this phase reports
  the evidence (does `rerank_score` separate zero-truth from real matches better than RRF score
  did?) but does not implement the gate itself.
- **WP-15.8 multi-vector retrieval** — unrelated backlog item, not touched here.
- **Any CLI/API/GUI-facing exposure of `rerank`.** Internal/eval-only for this phase, matching
  WP-15.5's original scope note ("do not add this to GUI or API scope yet").
- **Flipping any default to `True`.** Regardless of measured results, that is a distinct future
  decision made after Tyler reviews this phase's report — not assumed by this plan.

## 4. Architecture Decision (resolved up front, per Tyler's explicit request)

`core.ask.retrieve()` is **not** a shared retrieval choke point today. Direct inspection of all
three retrieval call sites found:

| Logic | Ask (`core/ask.py`) | Evidence (`services/evidence_service.py`) | Compare (`services/compare_service.py`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dense embed | `:628-629` | `:246-252` (own copy) | `:150-156` (own copy) |
| Sparse (BM25) embed | `:656-661` | `:255-263` (own copy) | `:158-166` (own copy) |
| Filter build | `:101-144` (`build_query_filter`) | `:266-279` (inline, different fields) | `:168-178` (inline) |
| RRF `query_points()` | `:704-710` | `:284-299` (own copy) | `:181-198` (own copy) |
| `min_score` threshold | `:714-720` | absent | absent |
| Candidate pool past `top_k` | `fusion_limit` widened when `min_score>0` | `limit=top_k` directly — no headroom | `limit=top_k` directly — no headroom |
| HyDE / query rewrite | `:610-652` | none | none |

Evidence and Compare each independently reimplement the same hybrid-search shape rather than
calling `retrieve()`, and neither has the candidate-pool headroom a reranker needs to reorder
within.

**Decision (confirmed with Tyler): build the reranker as a standalone, retrieval-agnostic module
and wire it into `core.ask.retrieve()` only for this phase.** Evidence and Compare are explicitly,
deliberately left unreranked — named as a scoped follow-up (§7), not silently deferred the way this
same recommendation has already been deferred three times (Phase 40 → 41 → 42).

Rationale: the reranker module (`rerank(query, candidates, top_k) -> candidates`) never assumes
who fetched its candidates, so wiring it into Evidence/Compare later is a plumbing change, not a
rewrite. This avoids taking on the larger regression surface of refactoring two live production
call sites (Evidence and Compare are used today, in the GUI and via MCP) inside the same phase as
the actual measurement work, and matches WP-15.5's own original scope note: "Do not add this to
GUI or API scope yet."

The alternative considered — centralizing the duplicated hybrid-search core across all three paths
first, then adding reranking uniformly — was rejected for this phase specifically because of scope
and risk, not because it's wrong: it does resolve a real, pre-existing violation of this project's
"business logic gets written once" architecture principle, and remains a reasonable direction for a
future WP once reranking itself has cleared its measurement gate.

## 5. New Dependency (stop-and-ask)

Per the project's private agent-docs guide, a new dependency is a conversation, not a unilateral
call — flagging explicitly: this phase proposes **FlashRank** (lightweight, ONNX-based, no `torch`
requirement — the same shape as `fastembed`'s existing BM25 model, downloading a small model to a
local cache on first use). This matches existing project guidance in both
`docs/TODO_future_improvements.txt` and the archived WP-15.5 writeup: "start with FlashRank for
speed, escalate to a cross-encoder only if FlashRank precision is insufficient." Proposed as a new
optional extra in `pyproject.toml` (mirroring `remote`/`mcp`/`grounding-check`) —
`rerank = ["flashrank>=0.2.0"]` — kept out of the base install while this remains an opt-in spike.
If it later graduates to default-on, moving it into base dependencies is a separate follow-up call.

## 6. Implementation Plan (not started — see §8 Process)

1. **`core/reranker.py`** (new): `rerank(query: str, candidates: list[dict], top_k: int) ->
   list[dict]`. Takes result dicts shaped like `retrieve()`'s existing `results` entries, scored
   against `description` + (`embedding_text` if present, else `source_quote`) — **not** bare
   `source_quote` unconditionally. Codex review (PR #190) caught that scoring only
   `description + source_quote` would discard the governing context WP-39.2's parent-stem
   reconstruction deliberately prefixes onto `embedding_text` for fragment-shaped quotes (e.g. a
   dangling `"(3) Restrain competition."` with no visible list-introducing clause). Without it, the
   8 `parent_child_context` gold-set queries could have their correct hits reach FlashRank as
   context-free fragments and get demoted, producing a false no-go result — `parent_stem`/
   `embedding_text` are already carried on `retrieve()`'s result dicts (`core/ask.py` already reads
   `hit.get("parent_stem")` for display, `pipeline/embed_and_index.py:build_embedding_text()`
   establishes the same `embedding_text`-over-`source_quote` precedence at index time; this mirrors
   it at rerank time for consistency). Returns the top_k reordered with a new `rerank_score` field
   attached. FlashRank imported lazily inside the function so importing this module doesn't
   hard-fail without the `rerank` extra installed; a clear error is raised only when `rerank=True`
   is actually requested without it.

2. **`core/ask.py`'s `retrieve()`**: add `rerank: bool = False` and `rerank_pool_size: int = 100`.
   When `rerank=True`:
   - Widen `fusion_limit` unconditionally to `max(rerank_pool_size, top_k)`, decoupled from
     `min_score` entirely (today, `core/ask.py:676`'s `max(top_k * 3, 50) if min_score > 0 else
     top_k` only widens when `min_score` is set, which a reranker can't rely on). **Codex review
     (PR #190) caught that the original `max(top_k * 3, 50)` proposal — 60 at the harness's
     `top_k=20` default — is too shallow for this very doc's own motivating example**: Q-T02's
     known-relevant records sit at ranks 33/51/69/87 (§1); a pool of 60 would never let the
     reranker see two of the four. `rerank_pool_size` is a first-class, independently configurable
     spike parameter (not derived from `top_k`) defaulting to 100 — enough margin over Q-T02's
     worst known case — and the harness (§6.3) sweeps it rather than treating 100 as
     self-evidently correct. This supersedes the archived WP-15.5 writeup's "N > k, e.g. 40-50"
     guidance, which predates Q-T02's concrete evidence (Phase 42).
   - Skip the existing pre-rerank `min_score` filter (`core/ask.py:714-720`) — Phase 41 already
     showed the RRF score threshold isn't a reliable relevance signal; filtering on it before
     reranking would reintroduce the problem the reranker exists to fix. Call `rerank()` on the
     full fused pool, trim to `top_k` by `rerank_score` after.
   - `rerank_score` flows through into each result dict alongside the existing `score` field.

3. **`eval/retrieval_eval_harness.py`**:
   - Add `--rerank` CLI flag / `rerank: bool = False` param, plus `--rerank-pool-size` /
     `rerank_pool_size: int = 100` param on `run_harness()`, passed to `retrieve()`. The
     measurement run (§10) sweeps at least two pool sizes (e.g. 50 and 100) rather than trusting
     the default in isolation — Codex review (PR #190) flagged that a single untested pool size
     could silently produce a "no improvement" result that's actually just a too-shallow pool, not
     evidence against reranking itself.
   - Add **Precision@5** to `compute_metrics()` — not currently computed (only recall@k and MRR
     exist today), but the primary gate metric per both Tyler's ask and
     `docs/TODO_future_improvements.txt`'s existing gate criteria:
     `precision@5 = |relevant ∩ top_5| / 5`.
   - `rerank_score` reporting: record each returned result's `rerank_score` in `per_query` output
     for **every** query, not only the 8 `shape == "zero"` ones. Codex review (PR #190) caught that
     the original zero-truth-only reporting couldn't actually support the plan's own §9 claim of
     checking whether `rerank_score` "separates off-topic from genuine-weak-match" — separation is
     a two-sided comparison, and weak-match evidence (e.g. `Q-B05`'s real matches, RRF-scored
     0.033–0.09 per Phase 41) requires the same score capture on the positive side. The Findings
     write-up (item 5 below) compares zero-truth vs. weak-match vs. strong-match `rerank_score`
     distributions directly, not zero-truth in isolation.
   - Latency: record wall-clock ms per query (`retrieve()` already returns `retrieval_ms`), report
     mean/p95 for baseline vs. reranked runs.

4. **`pyproject.toml`**: add the `rerank` optional extra (§5).

5. **This document**: fill in a Findings section with the live measurement results, the go/no-go
   decision against §8's gate, and flip Status to Complete once merged.

### Tests

- `tests/unit/test_reranker.py` (new): `rerank()` reorders a synthetic candidate list by relevance,
  attaches `rerank_score`, respects `top_k`, and raises a clear error (not a bare import traceback)
  when FlashRank isn't installed. Includes a `parent_child_context` case (Codex review, PR #190):
  a candidate with a dangling-fragment `source_quote` and a governing-clause-prefixed
  `embedding_text` scores using `embedding_text`, not the bare fragment.
- `tests/unit/test_ask_reranker.py` (new, or folded into `test_ask_run.py`): `retrieve(rerank=True)`
  widens the pool regardless of `min_score`, skips pre-rerank `min_score` filtering, calls the
  reranker module (mocked — no FlashRank install needed to run these), and `rerank=False` (default)
  is byte-for-byte unchanged from current behavior.
- `tests/unit/test_retrieval_eval_harness.py` (extended): Precision@5 computation including the
  fewer-than-5-results edge case, `--rerank` flag plumbing, zero-truth score reporting.

## 7. Backlog (follow-up work, named so it doesn't evaporate again)

- **Evidence/Compare reranking.** Prerequisite: give both paths `fusion_limit` headroom past
  `top_k` (they currently call `query_points(..., limit=top_k)` directly). Once WP-43's reranker
  module clears its own gate, wiring it into Evidence/Compare is expected to be a plumbing change
  against the already-built, retrieval-agnostic `core/reranker.py`, not a rewrite.
- **WP-15.9 corrective retrieval gate** — depends on this phase's zero-truth score-behavior
  findings.
- Centralizing the duplicated hybrid-search core across Ask/Evidence/Compare (§4's rejected
  alternative) remains a reasonable direction independent of reranking, if the project wants to
  resolve the underlying "business logic written once" violation directly.

## 8. Process — plan reviewed before implementation

Unlike prior phases, this plan itself goes through the normal Codex/Gemini PR review cycle before
any implementation code is written:

1. Branch `wp-43-reranker-spike` off `main` (done).
2. This document, plan-only, as the first commit — no `core/`, `eval/`, or `pyproject.toml`
   changes yet.
3. Open a PR, let Codex and Gemini review the plan itself.
4. Address findings on the plan by revising this document; still no implementation code.
5. Stop and wait for Tyler's explicit approval of the reviewed plan — a clean automated review of
   the plan doc is not, by itself, approval to start building.
6. Only after that approval: add the implementation commits from §6 to the same branch/PR, which
   then goes through its own normal review pass. Run the live measurement, fill in results, flip
   Status to Complete once merged.

## 9. Success Gate / Decision Criteria

- Precision@5 improves on the 45-query gold set.
- No regression on Recall@5/10/20/MRR versus current baseline.
- Zero-truth queries: document whether `rerank_score` separates off-topic from genuine-weak-match
  better than the RRF score did (Phase 41's finding). Not required to fully solve zero-truth in
  this phase (that's WP-15.9, out of scope here) — just to report the evidence.
- Latency acceptable for interactive CLI/GUI use — measured and reported, not hard-gated to a
  specific number (matches WP-15.5's original criterion).
- Regardless of results, no default flips to `True` anywhere in this phase.

## 10. Verification

- `pytest` full suite green, `ruff check .` clean.
- Fully reversible by construction, more so than Phase 42: `rerank` defaults to `False` everywhere,
  and this phase makes no ingestion/indexing/Qdrant/JSONL changes at all — a pure query-time
  addition. There is nothing to revert beyond not passing `rerank=True`.
- Live measurement run against the real 45-query gold set and live Qdrant/Ollama: baseline
  (`--rerank` omitted) vs. reranked, comparing Precision@5, Recall@5/10/20, MRR, `rerank_score`
  behavior across zero-truth/weak-match/strong-match queries, and latency. This is the deliverable
  Tyler asked for — the go/no-go decision is made from this data, not assumed.
- **Both arms run with `--no-hyde`.** Codex review (PR #190) caught that the harness's own file
  header (`eval/retrieval_eval_harness.py:21-32`) already documents `generate_hyde_hypothesis()`
  sampling at `temperature=0.3` with no seed, so HyDE's third RRF leg differs between separate runs
  of the same query — a single-run baseline-vs-reranked delta could partly reflect HyDE sampling
  noise rather than the reranker's actual effect. `--no-hyde` for both arms isolates the variable
  under test (at the cost of not reflecting default `hyde=True` production behavior). If time
  allows, a secondary `hyde=True` run repeated N≥3 times per arm (comparing distributions, not
  single points) can corroborate the `--no-hyde` result, but isn't required to reach a decision.

## 11. Findings

Implemented per §6 exactly as planned (`core/reranker.py`, `retrieve(rerank=..., rerank_pool_size=...)`,
harness `--rerank`/`--rerank-pool-size`/Precision@5/latency/per-query `rerank_score`), all unit
tests green (`pytest`, `ruff check .` both clean), then measured live against the real 45-query
gold set and live Qdrant/Ollama (`grc_requirements` at 1848 points), `--no-hyde` on both arms per
§10, FlashRank's default `ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2-v2` model, swept `rerank_pool_size` at 50 and 100.

### 11.1 Aggregate results

These artifacts were regenerated across this PR's review for two review-driven code changes
(§6.3's config-recording field, §6's `source_ref` addition to reranker input), plus one further
same-code rerun specifically to isolate measurement noise from code effects (below). All runs were
against the same, unchanged corpus (confirmed via `reqbot status` — same collection names, same
1848/839 point counts throughout). The committed files reflect the final code (with `source_ref`).

| Run | Precision@5 | Recall@5 | Recall@10 | Recall@20 | MRR | Mean latency | p95 latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline (no rerank) | 0.2629 | 0.5402 | 0.6208 | 0.6693 | 0.6267 | 1737ms | 2366ms |
| Reranked, pool=50 | 0.2514 | 0.5237 | 0.5985 | 0.6537 | 0.6390 | 1878ms | 2436ms |
| Reranked, pool=100 | 0.2629 | 0.5314 | 0.5995 | 0.6613 | 0.6297 | 2034ms | 2596ms |

(MiniLM-L-12 is a separate model/config — see §11.6, not folded into this table.)

**Precision@5 — the primary gate metric — never beat baseline**: pool=50 regresses, pool=100 ties
exactly (0.2629 both). **For TinyBERT, Recall@5 and Recall@10 are below baseline at both pool
sizes**, reproduced identically on the confirmatory rerun described below (MiniLM-L-12, §11.6, is
different: its Recall@5 is slightly above baseline). These are small differences on 35 scored
queries — see §11.7 for what they can and can't support. Recall@20 is also below baseline at both
pool sizes in the current code (this reverses what an earlier draft
of this document reported — see the correction immediately below). Latency increased by roughly 17%
at pool=100 (1737ms → 2034ms mean) — not itself gating (WP-15.5's "measure, don't hard-gate"
criterion) but a real cost for zero benefit on the gate's primary metric.

**Correction (Codex review, PR #191): an earlier draft of this section conflated a real code change
with measurement noise.** The regeneration for the config-recording fix (metadata only, no scoring
change) reproduced Precision@5/Recall@5/10/20 exactly, with only MRR shifting — genuine, narrow
noise, isolated cleanly since no code affecting scores changed. The *next* regeneration, for the
`source_ref` fix, does change what the reranker scores every candidate against, so the large shift
observed there (Recall@20 flipping from improving-over-baseline to regressing, Precision@5 moving a
full regression-to-tie range) cannot be attributed to noise the way the first shift was — Codex
correctly caught that this drew an unsupported conclusion. Re-ran the current (final) code
unchanged to check directly: the aggregate metrics above reproduced exactly, and at the per-query
level, 5 of 45 queries showed small `rerank_score`/ranking differences (max delta ≈0.07) that never
crossed a recall/precision threshold in this instance. So: **the large source_ref-adjacent shift is
best attributed mainly to that real code change, not to noise** — noise on the current code is real
but modest, smaller than first characterized, and did not move any of this section's headline
numbers on the confirmatory rerun. `--no-hyde` and `rewrite_query()`'s `temperature=0.0` rule out
HyDE sampling and non-deterministic rewrite as sources; the remaining source for the residual,
smaller noise is most likely Qdrant's HNSW dense-vector search breaking near-ties differently
between runs.

**Practical takeaway**: for TinyBERT, Precision@5 was never above baseline and Recall@5/10 were
below it in every measurement of the final code — this doesn't depend on the noise/code-effect
distinction above, though the size of the differences is small (§11.7).
For anything closer than that (e.g. comparing two pool sizes a few hundredths apart), a rigorous
future comparison should still run N≥3 repeats of *identical, unchanged* code and compare
distributions — the same discipline WP-37.2's original HyDE caution recommended for a different
reason — and should not draw conclusions from a run that also happened to change scoring code, as
an earlier draft of this section did. Documented as a corrected second caution in
`eval/retrieval_eval_harness.py`'s own module docstring.

### 11.2 Zero-truth score separation — a real code-driven effect, not noise, and worth watching

Directly answering Phase 40/41's backlog note (evaluate the reranker's confidence output against
the 8 zero-truth queries specifically). This section changed twice during review; both changes
matter, for different reasons.

**Change 1 (methodology, Codex review, PR #191)**: the original version pooled all 20 returned
results per zero-truth query against only the top-5 per real query — an apples-to-oranges
comparison at different depths, and not the statistic a corrective gate would actually threshold.
Redone as **per-query maximum `rerank_score`**, which at that point in the code (before the
`source_ref` fix) showed the two ranges not overlapping, by a margin of 0.0007 (zero-truth ceiling
0.0246 vs. the weakest real query's own ceiling, `Q-N10`, at 0.0253) — flagged at the time as
"razor-thin... would very plausibly flip."

**Change 2**: it did flip, after the `source_ref` fix (§6) — but per §11.1's correction, this is
best attributed to that real code change, not to run-to-run noise. Verified directly: a same-code
confirmatory rerun of the current code left `Q-N10`'s score unchanged, so its movement is
reproducible, not noisy. Current, final numbers:

| Bucket | n queries | min of per-query max | max of per-query max | mean of per-query max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Zero-truth | 8 | 0.0004 | **0.0256** (`Q-Z07`) | 0.0091 |
| Non-zero-truth (n=37 — every non-`zero`-shape query gets a `rerank_score`, including `Q-T04`/`Q-T05`, real on-topic content with no `requirement_id` to score recall against) | 37 | **0.0129** (`Q-N10`) | 0.9998 | 0.9224 |

`Q-N10` — a genuinely correct query (`recall@5=1.0`, its answer at rank 2) — now scores *below* the
zero-truth ceiling (0.0129 vs. 0.0256), reproducibly. Including `source_ref` in the reranker's
scoring text (a small, cheap addition of citation text) measurably worsened this specific boundary
case for this specific query. That's a real, useful, if narrow, finding about `source_ref`'s effect
— not evidence that the separation itself is meaningless.

What's stable across both changes: the **mean** (0.9245 before the `source_ref` fix [after Codex's
separate arithmetic-error correction] vs. 0.9224 after — consistent) and the general **bimodal
shape** (most real queries score near-maximum confidence — 32 of 37 at 0.94+ — while a handful of
genuinely correct queries score surprisingly low: `Q-T03`, `Q-C04`, and now `Q-N10` too). The
mean-level gap between zero-truth (~0.01) and real queries (~0.92) is large and has held across both
versions of the code; the *boundary* behavior — whether the single worst real query beats the single
best zero-truth query — is real but sensitive to exactly this kind of input-text change, and (per
§11.1) there's also a smaller, genuine noise component on top of that.

**Conclusion: a real, code-sensitive effect, not a settled property of the approach.** The
mean-level signal still supports Phase 41's hypothesis that a calibrated per-candidate score is a
fundamentally different kind of signal than RRF's fused score (which Phase 41 found gives off-topic
queries *higher* scores than genuine weak matches outright, 1.07 vs. 0.033-0.09 — a problem no
threshold could ever fix). But the specific boundary-case claim is demonstrably sensitive to small,
reasonable-looking implementation choices (like whether to include `source_ref`), which is itself
worth knowing before anyone designs a corrective gate around a fixed threshold. A future WP-15.9
scoping conversation needs its own careful, multi-run, multi-input-variant measurement before
treating either "a threshold exists" or "the boundary case is thin" as settled.

### 11.3 Flagship case (Q-T02) — still not fixed; cause not yet isolated

Phase 42's motivating example was checked directly rather than assumed. Live, fresh check today
(not relying on Phase 42's original numbers, since the corpus has re-indexed since):
`core.ask.retrieve(query, top_k=200, min_score=0, hyde=False)` with the same query rewrite the
harness itself applies (`"AF critical asset identification process task critical assets
nomination approval"`) places Q-T02's three gold-labelled records at:

- `REQ-2d5b8006ec40` — rank 40 (RRF score 0.0487)
- `REQ-7758064f03f2` — rank 116 (RRF score 0.0170)
- `REQ-8864b3fc4a01` — **not present in the top 200 at all**

**Caveat on this diagnostic (Codex review, PR #191):** `top_k` also sets each retrieval leg's
prefetch depth (`prefetch_limit = max(100, top_k*5, fusion_limit)` in `core/ask.py`) — so this
`top_k=200` check fetched 1,000 candidates per leg, while the real pool=100 runs (`top_k=20`) fetched
100 per leg. The RRF inputs differ, so these ranks do not establish which records were in the actual
pool=100 candidate list. Q-T02's gold records were absent from the final top 20; their membership in
the actual pre-rerank pool was not recorded, so candidate-generation failure cannot yet be separated
from reranking failure (§11.5 proposes recording the real pools). Inspecting the pool=100 run's
actual output for Q-T02: the reachable one (`REQ-2d5b8006ec40`, "HAF, MAJCOM/DRUs, FOAs... review/
validate nominated TCAs" — squarely on-topic for the query's "approving" half) still didn't crack
the reranked top 20. FlashRank instead gave near-maximum confidence (0.99, 0.99, 0.99, 0.98, 0.98,
0.98) to six candidates describing the CARM Program's general purpose and asset-prioritization
role — topically adjacent, plausible-sounding, but not the specific process-step content the query
actually asks for. This is a precise, concrete instance of the aggregate Precision@5 regression:
the reranker is confidently promoting near-miss generalities over an on-topic specific.

**Conclusion: reranking with FlashRank's default model did not fix the case that motivated this
WP.** Whether the missing gold records ever reached the reranker is unresolved (see caveat above);
the on-topic record that likely did reach it (`REQ-2d5b8006ec40`) was outranked by generic
CARM-program candidates.

### 11.4 Go/No-Go decision

Against §9's gate (final code, confirmed reproducible via a same-code rerun — §11.1):
- ❌ Precision@5 improves — **failed** (pool=50 regresses, pool=100 ties baseline exactly — never
  an improvement at either pool size — §11.1).
- ❌ No regression on Recall@5/10/20/MRR — **failed** (TinyBERT: Recall@5/10/20 below baseline at
  both pool sizes, reproducibly; MiniLM: Recall@10/20 below baseline — §11.6. The differences are
  small relative to sampling uncertainty — §11.7 — but the gate was written as a strict
  no-regression rule).
- ✅ Zero-truth score-separation evidence reported — **met** (the gate only requires reporting the
  evidence, not a clean result): the mean-level separation is real and stable, but the specific
  boundary-case claim (does the worst real query beat the best zero-truth query) is demonstrably
  sensitive to small, reasonable implementation choices — §11.2 found `source_ref`'s inclusion
  alone flipped it, reproducibly, not through noise.
- ✅ Latency measured and reported, not hard-gated — **met** (a real, repeatable ~17% increase at
  pool=100, moot given the precision/recall gate failure).

**Decision: No-Go**, meaning *no demonstrated deployment benefit under the tested configurations*
— not a finding that reranking cannot help ReqBot (§11.7). FlashRank's default
`ms-marco-TinyBERT-L-2-v2` model, over either candidate pool size tested, does not clear the bar
this WP set before implementation started. Per §9 and
Tyler's explicit framing throughout this WP, **no default changes** — `rerank` stays `False`
everywhere; production Ask/Search behavior is exactly what it was before this WP, byte-for-byte
(confirmed by `test_rerank_false_default_never_calls_reranker` and this run's own baseline column
above). **Still No-Go after also testing a stronger model — see §11.6.**

This is not a failed WP — it is exactly the answer a measurement-gated spike exists to produce.
The infrastructure built here (the standalone `core/reranker.py` module, decoupled candidate-pool
sizing, the harness's Precision@5/latency/rerank_score instrumentation) is real, reusable, and not
wasted: a future attempt with a stronger model can reuse all of it and would only need to swap
which model `core/reranker.py`'s `Ranker()` construction points at.

### 11.5 Backlog (concrete next steps, not decided)

- ~~Try a stronger bundled FlashRank model before concluding reranking itself is not viable.~~
  **Done — see §11.6.** Tested `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2`: moved Recall@5/MRR in the right direction
  but didn't clear the gate either, at a much higher and consistent latency cost, and with a wide,
  stable zero-truth overlap (worse than TinyBERT's own narrower, code-sensitive boundary case). Not
  worth testing FlashRank's other remaining bundled models (`ms-marco-MultiBERT-L-12`,
  `rank-T5-flan`) on the strength of this trend without a specific reason to expect otherwise.
- **Bounded follow-up experiment (proposed, not started; separate WP):** (1) record each query's
  actual pre-rerank candidate pool at the real `top_k=20`/pool=100 settings, and measure pool recall
  — the ceiling any reranker could reach; (2) compare RRF order against both models on those
  identical frozen pools; (3) vary the reranker's query input: the original question vs. the current
  `dense_query` (the acronym-expanded retrieval rewrite). `dense_query` is an untested experimental
  choice, not a known defect — it may help or hurt a cross-encoder; (4) add passage-format variants
  only if (1)–(3) justify it; (5) audit labels for newly promoted results, since gold lists can be
  incomplete (Q-T02's notes list nine process-step records but only three are labelled). A low pool
  recall for Q-T02 would explain why no reranker recovers *its* records; it would not answer whether
  reranking helps other queries, so it should not by itself end the experiment.
- **A different cross-encoder runtime** (e.g. `sentence-transformers`) is a possible later step, but
  note it is not "escalating to a cross-encoder": TinyBERT and MiniLM via FlashRank are already
  cross-encoders. It would change the runtime and possibly the model — a new, heavier dependency,
  its own stop-and-ask conversation. Any such follow-up should budget for same-code confirmatory
  reruns before attributing any observed delta to noise, given §11.1's correction, and N≥3-repeat
  measurement for fine-grained comparisons specifically.
- **Evidence/Compare reranking** — unchanged from §3/§7: still blocked on giving those paths
  candidate-pool headroom past `top_k`, and now additionally motivated less urgently given this
  spike's own models didn't clear the gate on the one path they were tried against.
- **WP-15.9 corrective retrieval gate** — §11.2's zero-truth separation result is real at the mean
  level but its specific boundary-case behavior is sensitive to reasonable-looking implementation
  choices (confirmed: `source_ref`'s inclusion alone flipped it, reproducibly). A future scoping
  conversation needs its own careful, multi-input-variant measurement before treating either "a
  threshold exists" or "the boundary is thin" as a fixed property of the approach.

### 11.6 Stronger model check: ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2

Per §11.5's backlog, tested FlashRank's larger `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-12-v2` model (21.6MB vs.
TinyBERT's 3.26MB) — zero new dependency, `core/reranker.py`'s `model_name` parameter (added for
exactly this) is all that changed. Same methodology otherwise: `rerank_pool_size=100`, `--no-hyde`,
same 45-query gold set, same live corpus.

| Run | Precision@5 | Recall@5 | Recall@10 | Recall@20 | MRR | Mean latency | p95 latency |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | 0.2629 | 0.5402 | 0.6208 | 0.6693 | 0.6267 | 1737ms | 2366ms |
| TinyBERT, pool=100 | 0.2629 | 0.5314 | 0.5995 | 0.6613 | 0.6297 | 2034ms | 2596ms |
| MiniLM-L-12, pool=100 | 0.2514 | **0.5456** | 0.5988 | 0.6653 | **0.6778** | **6734ms** | **7979ms** |

(All figures are from the final, current code — §11.1's confirmatory rerun found the current
TinyBERT numbers reproducible; MiniLM was measured once at the same final code, not separately
re-confirmed, but uses the identical harness and methodology.) MiniLM-L-12 is the best-performing
configuration on Recall@5 and MRR — Recall@5 is slightly above baseline (0.5456 vs. 0.5402) and MRR
is higher (0.6778 vs. 0.6267); neither difference is distinguishable from sampling noise at n=35
(§11.7). Higher MRR alongside lower Precision@5 is a plausible pattern, not an anomaly: a model can
move the first relevant answer up while pushing other relevant answers out of the top five. Precision@5 (0.2514) is below both
baseline and TinyBERT's tie, and Recall@10/20 both regress versus baseline — so this still does not
clear §9's gate as written (a regression on any one of Recall@5/10/20/MRR disqualifies, not a net
average).

**Latency is the more serious, and more consistent, problem**: mean retrieval time roughly
quadrupled versus baseline (1737ms → 6734ms, ~3.9x), p95 similarly (2366ms → 7979ms, ~3.4x) — the larger
model's ONNX inference cost dominates. TinyBERT's much smaller latency increase was arguably
tolerable; this isn't, for interactive CLI/GUI use.

**Q-T02 is still unfixed** with MiniLM too, the same shape of failure as TinyBERT: its top picks are
the same plausible-but-generic CARM-program candidates seen under TinyBERT (`REQ-9a1f01a2d295`,
`REQ-f78038d96493`, `REQ-95cbb901f073`, `REQ-70f62fcdd0cf` — reordered among themselves, but the
same small set), and the one reachable target (`REQ-2d5b8006ec40`, rank 40 in the RRF pool) never
cracks the reranked top 20 under either model, in any measurement taken. Whether this
reflects which candidates reach the reranker (pool depth) or the models' ranking behavior on this
query is not established (§11.3 caveat); the reranked output is consistent across both models.

**Zero-truth separation**: MiniLM's zero-truth ceiling is `Q-Z06` ("parking and traffic enforcement
on a military installation" — deliberately off-topic, keyword-overlapping on "military
installation") at 0.2629 — higher than several genuinely on-topic queries' own per-query maxima
(`Q-T03`: 0.1134, `Q-C04`: 0.1523), a wide overlap. §11.2's finding for TinyBERT (a narrower,
code-sensitive boundary case, not simply "clean") still holds a real distinction here: MiniLM's
overlap is wide by any measure, not a case of a specific input-text choice tipping a close call one
way or the other. If anything's true about model-size effects on this dimension, it's that MiniLM is
more consistently worse, not better.

**Conclusion: still No-Go**, and this specific stronger model isn't the answer either. It moves MRR
and Recall@5 in the right direction but trades away both latency and zero-truth calibration to get
there, doesn't actually beat TinyBERT on Precision@5, and still doesn't fix the motivating case.
This backlog question now has a real, measured answer rather than remaining open speculation.

### 11.7 Limitations on interpreting these results

- **Sample size.** 45 gold queries, but precision/recall/MRR are averaged over the **35** with
  scoreable relevant records. Per-query paired changes versus baseline (reproduced from the committed
  `results.json` files; paired bootstrap, 10,000 resamples, seed 0):

  | Run | Metric | Mean Δ | Queries up / down / tied | 95% interval |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | TinyBERT pool=100 | Precision@5 | +0.0000 | 3 / 4 / 28 | [−0.034, +0.040] |
  | TinyBERT pool=100 | Recall@5 | −0.0088 | 3 / 4 / 28 | [−0.096, +0.079] |
  | MiniLM pool=100 | Precision@5 | −0.0114 | 3 / 6 / 26 | [−0.046, +0.029] |
  | MiniLM pool=100 | Recall@5 | +0.0054 | 3 / 6 / 26 | [−0.064, +0.088] |
  | MiniLM pool=100 | MRR | +0.0512 | 7 / 5 / 23 | [−0.057, +0.163] |

  Every interval, for every metric and run (including those not shown), includes zero. Re-running the
  same queries checks reproducibility (§11.1); it does not measure how the models would perform on
  other queries. The No-Go is a conservative reading of a strict pre-agreed gate, not evidence of a
  statistically established regression or of established harm.
- **Gold-label completeness.** Every returned ID outside a query's gold list counts as irrelevant.
  That holds only if the lists are complete, and at least one (Q-T02) is known not to be. A
  reranker that promotes a genuinely relevant but unlabelled record is scored as worse.
- **Known extraction gaps stay in the scored set.** Keeping them as misses is appropriate for overall
  system quality but mixes retrieval failure with extraction failure; a separate view restricted to
  queries whose relevant records are actually present in the candidate pool would isolate the
  reranker's opportunity to help (§11.5).
- **Two models, one input format.** Only FlashRank's TinyBERT and MiniLM-L-12 were tested, with one
  passage format (description + context + `source_ref`) scored against `dense_query`. Nothing here
  speaks to other models or other inputs.

**Accurate summary:** these two configurations show no demonstrated deployment benefit and fail the
pre-agreed gate; the infrastructure is retained; the broader question of whether reranking can help
ReqBot remains open.
