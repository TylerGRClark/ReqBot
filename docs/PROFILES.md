# Profiles

A profile is a JSON file at `profiles/<name>.json` that configures ReqBot's pipeline for a
specific compliance domain. Today only `cybersecurity` is a real profile; see
[Adding a new profile](#adding-a-new-profile) before assuming a second one is a small change.

The loader (`core/profiles.py`) validates every top-level field's type and rejects any top-level
key it doesn't recognize. That guarantee doesn't extend below the top level, though: nested content
inside `checklist_guidance` other than its one defined sub-field (`evidence_categories`) is neither
type-checked nor rejected — see that field's row below. `core.profiles.load_profile()` is the only
supported way to read a profile; nothing else parses `profiles/*.json` directly.

## Schema

### Required fields

| Field | Type | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `string` | Must match the filename (`profiles/foo.json` must have `"name": "foo"`) — checked last, after every other validation passes. |
| `obligation_verbs` | `string[]`, non-empty | **No longer in the extraction prompt.** Until October 2026, requirement finding (Step C, `pipeline/llm_extract_requirements.py`) substituted this list into the prompt's `{obligation_verbs}` placeholder. The inclusive prompt that replaced it asks for anything that tells a party what it must, should, may or must not do, and does not list verbs. The field is still required, and `services/checklist_missed.py` uses the single-word entries as extra imperative verbs when it scans for possible missed requirements. |
| `skip_sections` | `string[]`, empty allowed | Chunking (`pipeline/chunk_text.py`) — section headings to exclude from the corpus (e.g. `"GLOSSARY"`, `"REFERENCES"`). Takes effect on every ingest — docling (structure-aware parsing) is the only ingestion path as of WP-34.1, so there's no longer a legacy fallback where this field silently no-ops. |
| `domain_tags` | `string[]`, non-empty | **Currently unused.** Enrichment is switched off (October 2026), so nothing assigns or checks tags; the field stays required. Earlier behavior, kept for reference: **Not requirement finding (Step C)** — `PASS1_PROMPT_TEMPLATE` only asks the LLM for `source_quote`/`source_ref`, it never references tags. The real prompting happens in the enrichment step's (Step D.5) prompt (`pipeline/enrich_requirements.py`'s `{valid_tags}` placeholder) — that's where the LLM is actually told to pick from this vocabulary. `pipeline/parse_and_normalize.py` (Step D) then silently drops any tag Step D.5 returned that isn't in this list. (Step C's `validate_requirement()`/`process_chunk()` do accept a `valid_domain_tags` parameter, but since Pass-1's prompt never asks the LLM for a `domain_tags` field, that filter always runs against empty input today — effectively inert, not a live consumer.) |
| `requirement_types` | `string[]`, non-empty | **Currently unused**, for the same reason as `domain_tags`. Earlier behavior, kept for reference: same story as `domain_tags`: the enrichment step's (Step D.5) prompt (`{valid_types}`) is the real consumer, Step D enforces it afterward, and Step C's equivalent parameter is inert for the same reason. |

### Optional fields

| Field | Type | Default | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `description` | `string` | `""` | Not consumed by the pipeline — human-readable only. |
| `version` | `string` or `null` | `null` | Not consumed by the pipeline — informational only. |
| `checklist_guidance` | `object` | `{}` | **Currently not consumed anywhere in the pipeline.** Validated (see below) and round-tripped through `load_profile()`, but no code in `services/checklist_service.py` or `pipeline/checklist_export.py` reads it yet — populating it today has no effect on generated checklists. Its only defined sub-field is `evidence_categories` (`string[]`), which is schema-validated the same way as the other list fields but is likewise unread. Treat this as a reserved-for-future field, not live configuration. |

### Validation rules

- **Unknown top-level fields are rejected outright** — `load_profile()` raises `ValueError` on any
  top-level key not in the required/optional lists above. This does not apply recursively:
  `checklist_guidance` accepts arbitrary unvalidated nested keys other than `evidence_categories`
  (e.g. `{"checklist_guidance": {"typo": 123}}` loads without error).
- `obligation_verbs`, `domain_tags`, and `requirement_types` must be **non-empty** lists of strings —
  an empty list here would produce either a broken prompt or validation that silently
  accepts/rejects everything. `skip_sections` is the one list field allowed to be empty.
- Every list item must be a string; a non-string item anywhere raises `ValueError` naming the exact
  index.
- `name` in the file must match the filename stem exactly (`profiles/cybersecurity.json`'s `name`
  field must be `"cybersecurity"`) — checked only after every other check passes.
- Profile names can't contain path separators (`/` or `\`) — `load_profile()` rejects those before
  even trying to open a file.

## `profiles/test-domain.json` is not a second real domain

It exists purely as a minimal fixture for pipeline plumbing tests (`"Minimal test profile for
pipeline plumbing validation only. Not a real domain."` — its own `description` field says as
much). Don't treat it as precedent for what a second real profile should look like; it deliberately
has the bare minimum required fields and nothing else.

## Operational note: non-default profiles bypass the requirement-finding cache

`pipeline/llm_extract_requirements.py`'s `run()` defaults to the `cybersecurity` profile when none
is passed. If you run with any other profile, Step C **always re-extracts from scratch** — the
prompt-hash cache that normally lets you resume an interrupted run without re-calling the LLM is
bypassed entirely for non-default profiles, because cached records don't yet track which profile
produced them (a known gap, not yet fixed). Budget for a full re-extraction, not a resumed one,
whenever testing a profile other than `cybersecurity`.

## Should you add a second profile right now?

Probably not yet (decision recorded 2026-07-27, see `docs/TODO_future_improvements.txt`'s
Decisions and Guardrails #8). Cybersecurity is meant to be the first domain, not the only one
(`docs/PRODUCT_PRD.md`'s PR-2 names `hr_policy`/`safety`/`finance`/`acquisition` as future
candidates) — but three things make now a bad time to actually build one: no source documents exist
yet for any candidate domain, testing a new profile is expensive (see the cache-bypass note above),
and the one existing profile still leaks cybersecurity-specific assumptions into supposedly generic
code (e.g. `evidence_service.py`'s synthesis prompt hardcodes NIST control-family vocabulary —
tracked as Phase 32's WP-32.7). Revisit once that's actually fixed, not before.

## Adding a new profile

1. Create `profiles/<name>.json` with the five required fields above, matching `name` to the
   filename.
2. Decide `obligation_verbs` (required, but no longer shapes the extraction prompt; it feeds the possible-missed scan) and
   `domain_tags`/`requirement_types` (shapes what the enrichment step's (Step D.5) prompt classifies into; the redesign plan switches that step off) for
   the new domain — get them right before a real ingest run rather than iterating against
   production data.
3. Pick `skip_sections` — it applies on every ingest (see above).
4. Run `python3 cli/reqbot.py ingest <doc.pdf> --profile <name>` and expect a full extraction pass
   (no cache) per the operational note above.
5. `checklist_guidance` can be included for forward-compatibility but has no effect today — don't
   spend design time on it expecting a behavior change.
