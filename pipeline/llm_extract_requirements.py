"""Step C: Extract cybersecurity requirements from text chunks using a local LLM.

Input:  chunks.jsonl (from Step B)
Output:
  - raw_responses.jsonl  — one line per chunk, written last as the chunk's completion marker:
        {chunk_id, model, prompt_hash, raw_response, timestamp, status, done_reason, num_predict,
        retried_larger}; status is complete, truncated or failed (WP-45.0.2) and decides what resume redoes
  - extracted_requirements.jsonl — one line per requirement:
        {chunk_id, requirement_id, description, source_ref, domain_tags, requirement_type, source_quote}
  - parse_failures.jsonl — chunks whose LLM response could not be parsed

This step is nondeterministic. It calls a local Ollama model and isolates all
LLM interaction. Raw responses are always logged before parsing so that
Step D can be rerun without re-calling the LLM.

Resume (same output directory): chunks that finished (complete or truncated) are skipped, keyed by
chunk_id and prompt hash; failed chunks are redone, replacing any rows an earlier attempt left.

PASS1_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a requirements extraction system for cybersecurity compliance documents.

Your ONLY task: identify and extract ACTIONABLE REQUIREMENTS from the text below.
A requirement is something an organization MUST DO — it expresses obligation, mandate, or necessity.

Extract statements containing obligation or mandate language including: {obligation_verbs}

DO NOT extract:
- Definitions or glossary entries
- Document change logs or errata (e.g., "Change X to Y")
- Tables of contents or section headings
- Cross-references to other controls (e.g., "Related controls: AC-2, IA-1")
- General background, context, or informational text

Return a JSON object with a single "requirements" key whose value is an array.
No markdown code fences. No text before or after the JSON object.
If there are no actionable requirements, return: {"requirements": []}

Each element in the "requirements" array must be a JSON object with exactly these keys:
- "source_quote": (REQUIRED) The exact verbatim quote from the text establishing this requirement
  (under 500 characters). Copy word-for-word — do NOT paraphrase or summarize. If you cannot find
  an exact verbatim quote for a requirement, do NOT include that requirement.
- "source_ref": The document-specific locator for this requirement (e.g., "AC-4", "Section 5.2.1",
  "Para 3.4.1") or "" if none is visible in the text. Copy it exactly as written — do not infer or construct.

--- EXAMPLES ---

Example 1 — NIST prose (requirements present):
Text: "AC-3 ACCESS ENFORCEMENT\nControl: The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.\nSupplemental Guidance: Access control policies (e.g., identity-based policies, role-based policies, attribute-based policies) and access enforcement mechanisms are employed by organizations to control access between active entities or subjects and passive entities or objects in information systems."
Output: {"requirements": [{"source_quote": "The information system enforces approved authorizations for logical access to information and system resources in accordance with applicable access control policies.", "source_ref": "AC-3"}]}

Example 2 — DoD policy table (multiple requirements):
Text: "3.2 POLICY\n3.2.1 All DoD information systems shall implement multi-factor authentication for all privileged user accounts.\n3.2.2 Password complexity requirements shall conform to NIST SP 800-63B guidelines. Minimum password length is 12 characters.\n3.2.3 See Table 3.2-1 for password requirements by account type (informational)."
Output: {"requirements": [{"source_quote": "All DoD information systems shall implement multi-factor authentication for all privileged user accounts.", "source_ref": "3.2.1"}, {"source_quote": "Password complexity requirements shall conform to NIST SP 800-63B guidelines. Minimum password length is 12 characters.", "source_ref": "3.2.2"}]}

Example 3 — References section (no requirements):
Text: "1. REFERENCES\na. DoD Instruction 8500.01, Cybersecurity, March 14, 2014, as amended.\nb. NIST Special Publication 800-53, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations, Revision 5, September 2020.\nc.
