# real prose by checking whether a word's first letter is lowercase --
# meaningless once the text it's looking at is ALL CAPS, since every word
# "looks like" a citation token regardless of what it actually is.
#
# Round 6 bailed (didn't reject) whenever `remainder.isupper()` -- but a
# short, genuine citation-only remainder made purely of acronym/document-ID
# tokens (e.g. "Term, as defined in CNSSI 4009.") is *also* all-uppercase on
# its own, so that wrongly let real citation-only fragments through
# uncaught. Round 8 widened the check to `source_quote.isupper()` (the whole
# quote) to fix that -- but a real quote whose citation opener is normal/
# title case while only its *governing clause* is rendered in caps (e.g.
# "Compliance data, as defined in DODI 2000.26, SHALL BE REPORTED
# IMMEDIATELY TO THE ISSO.") has neither the whole quote nor even the whole
# remainder all-uppercase (the citation portion, "DODI 2000.26,", isn't) --
# so neither round 6's nor round 8's version catches it, and a real
# obligation clause gets misclassified as citation-shaped word by word,
# silently discarding a real requirement. Codex's local review confirmed
# this via direct execution, including a case mixing a title-case citation
# with an all-caps clause in the very same remainder.
#
# What actually distinguishes the two is the *shape* of the all-caps run,
# not whether the whole string happens to be uppercase: a real citation's
# acronyms appear as isolated all-caps tokens breaking up otherwise mixed-
# case document titles and numbers, while a "shouted" clause is a run of
# consecutive all-caps words ("SHALL BE REPORTED IMMEDIATELY..." runs to 5).
# Flagging a run of 2+ consecutive all-caps multi-letter alphabetic words
# (skipping over, not resetting on, recognized connector words and any token
# containing a digit -- a real clause naturally contains "TO"/"THE" mid-run,
# or a number like "WITHIN 30 DAYS", without that breaking the clause) as
# unreliable-to-classify-by-case catches all three of Codex's examples plus
# every prior round's test case.
#
# Gemini's next automatic re-review (PR #181) found two more real gaps at
# the original threshold of 3: (1) a digit-only token (e.g. "30" in "SHALL
# REPORT WITHIN 30 DAYS") failed `.isalpha()` and *reset* the run instead of
# being skipped like a connector word, breaking runs that should have stayed
# intact; (2) threshold=3 still missed a short 2-word all-caps clause with no
# digits at all ("MUST COMPLY"). Fixing (1) alone doesn't fix (2) -- a clause
# with no digit token in it never benefits from skip-instead-of-reset.
# Lowering the threshold to 2 is the same "no text-level signal safely
# distinguishes two genuinely different real shapes" wall already hit and
# resolved once this session for _is_orphaned_list_item()'s marker+
# word-count branch: a 2-consecutive-all-caps-word run can be a real citation
# (an acronym pair like "NIST SP") or a real short clause ("MUST COMPLY"),
# and nothing about the words themselves tells them apart. Applying the same
# principle Tyler set there -- a missed catch (leaving a real citation-only
# fragment unrejected) is a strictly safer failure than a false rejection
# (silently discarding a real short obligation clause) -- threshold lowered
# to 2. Confirmed the one existing test this costs
# (`"Control, as defined in NIST SP 800-53."`) is itself a synthetic
# calibration example added during round 8, not a real fixture or live-corpus

    Three broader candidate signals were tried and rejected during
    calibration against WP-38.1's audit fixture (eval/audit_wp38_1/) because
    each produced a real false positive against a genuine, correctly-kept
    requirement in this corpus:

    - "Starts with a lowercase letter" -- this corpus's real DoD/AF-style
      responsibility lists commonly extract individual list items starting
      mid-sentence on a shared "will:" governing clause (e.g. a real,
      correctly-kept "establish, direct, and administer all aspects of
      their respective organization's SCI security programs"), so
      lowercase-first is common in genuine content here, not just fragments.
    - "First word is a bare modal (shall/will/must/should/may)" -- same
      cause: a real, correctly-kept record ("must have a lawful governmental
      purpose for such access") starts exactly this way.
    - "Ends in a bare trailing comma" -- a real, correctly-kept record
      ("Reporting or accounting for UD of CUI shall be done in accordance
      with Paragraph 3.5.a(4),") ends in one too; the comma there is a
      punctuation artifact of a longer source list, not a sign the quote's
      own content is incomplete.

    A copula-first quote containing "?" anywhere is excluded too (Gemini
    round 5, tightened round 7): a real interrogative requirement, the kind
    assessment-procedure documents like NIST SP 800-53A use (e.g. "Is
    multi-factor authentication enforced for all administrative access?"),
    puts the subject *after* the copula via subject-auxiliary inversion --
    grammatically complete, not a missing subject the way the declarative
    case is. This corpus doesn't currently have any assessment-
    questionnaire-style documents ingested, but a future one plausibly
    could. Round 5's first fix only checked the quote's trailing
    non-alphanumeric run, which misses a "?" followed by more content (e.g.
    a trailing parenthetical or control-ID note: "...enforced? (see NIST SP
    800-53)") -- checking the whole quote for "?" is safe here since this
    function only ever fires on an already-narrow trigger (bare-copula-first-
    word); a declarative fragment that happens to also contain a "?"
    somewhere else is a genuinely contrived case, and exempting it errs
    toward not discarding real data, the same direction every other choice
    in this function already errs.

    Only the bare-copula-first-word signal survived calibration with zero
    false positives against the fixture's 284 real records -- catches 1 of
    WP-38.1's 6 dangling-clause fragment examples. The other 5 (a preamble
    ending mid-clause, a subordinate clause with no main clause, a bare
