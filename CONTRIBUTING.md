# Contributing to ReqBot

ReqBot accepts contributions from the community. Before you start, read this
document — especially the CLA requirement.

---

## CLA Requirement (Non-Negotiable)

Every contributor must sign the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md) before
any code, documentation, or other contribution can be merged. No exceptions.

The CLA assigns copyright of your contributions to the project maintainer. This
is required to preserve dual licensing (AGPL v3 + commercial). Without sole
copyright ownership, the project cannot offer commercial licenses.

**What this means for you:**

- You still retain a perpetual license to your own work (Section 3 of the CLA).
- You cannot revoke your contribution after it is merged.
- Your employer may need to approve the CLA if your work contract assigns IP to
  them. Resolve this before submitting.

**How to sign:** Follow the instructions at the bottom of [CLA.md](CLA.md).
Include the signed block in your first merge request, or email it in advance.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Open a GitHub issue. Include:

- What you did (command, input, config)
- What you expected
- What actually happened (paste error output)
- ReqBot version (`reqbot --version`), OS, Python version

### Suggesting Features

Open an issue tagged `feature-request`. Describe the problem you want solved,
not just the solution you have in mind.

### Submitting Code

1. **Sign the CLA** if you haven't already.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch off `main`.
3. Make your changes. Keep commits small and messages descriptive.
4. Test your changes — at minimum, confirm the pipeline still runs end-to-end.
5. Open a merge request against `main`.

### What Makes a Good Merge Request

- **One concern per MR.** Don't bundle unrelated fixes.
- **Descriptive title and body.** What changed, why, how to test.
- **No unnecessary reformatting.** If you didn't change the logic, don't
  reformat the file.
- **Working code.** MRs that break the pipeline won't be reviewed.

## Operational Notes

Use the [deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for a virtual-environment source
install or Docker setup. The [operations runbook](docs/OPERATIONS.md) covers
resume, backups, reindex, and troubleshooting; the
[developer architecture reference](ARCHITECTURE.md) covers module ownership and
change dependencies.

- **JSONL is the source of record.** Qdrant is a rebuildable index.
- **Resume in the existing run directory.** Step C's prompt-hash cache lives
  there; creating another run does not reuse that directory's cache.
- **Preserve artifact modification times.** Reindex selects the newest run and
  freshest acceptable gated/enriched/normalized tier using those times.
- **Context size varies.** Check the selected model's limits and the actual
  retrieved text before raising result counts or enabling source context.
- **Build artifacts are generated.** Edit frontend source, then rebuild;
  never edit `frontend/dist/` directly.

---

## Code Standards

- Python 3.12+. No type-checking enforcement yet, but type hints are welcome.
- No new dependencies without discussion. ReqBot runs in air-gapped environments;
  every dependency is a liability.
- JSONL is the system of record. Qdrant is a rebuildable index. Design
  accordingly.
- Scripts should be independently runnable with `--help`. Follow the existing
  pattern.

---

## What Won't Be Accepted

- Contributions without a signed CLA.
- Changes that require an internet connection at runtime (beyond Ollama/Qdrant
  on the local network).
- "Refactors" with no functional change and no clear justification.
- AI-generated code dumps with no evidence of testing or understanding.

## Questions

If you're unsure whether a contribution is welcome, open an issue first or email
**[EMAIL]** before investing time.
