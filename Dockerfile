# ReqBot — production image
#
# Multi-stage build:
#   1. frontend — pinned node:20 image builds frontend/dist/. Anyone building this
#      image never needs Node/npm on their own host, regardless of what a bare
#      source/dev checkout requires (see build/build-frontend.sh).
#   2. runtime  — installs the reqbot package (docling is a base dependency as of
#      WP-34.1, the only ingestion path) and copies the built frontend in as
#      package data.
#
# This image does not install, start, or manage Qdrant or Ollama — point it at
# existing instances via REQBOT_QDRANT_URL / REQBOT_OLLAMA_URL (see
# docker-compose.example.yml).

# Docling's OCR (rapidocr) depends on the non-headless opencv-python, which loads libGL, libxcb
# and glib at import time. The slim base image has none of them, so without these packages the
# first PDF conversion fails with "cannot open shared object file" (libxcb.so.1 / libGL.so.1).
# libgl1 pulls in libxcb transitively. CI's docker job runs build/smoke_parse_chunk.py to catch a
# regression here.
